## Cell-specific port overrides
# Example: to run the SampleModel cell on port 9090, set:
# cell.ports.SampleModel=9090
# You can also uncomment the example below to enable it by default when running locally:
# cell.ports.SampleModel=9090

# If a cell class is annotated with @Cell(port=xxxx) that port will be used
# unless overridden here. Use the cell name (the value of @Cell or the
# cell class simple name) as the property key suffix.

# Health endpoint per cell is available at /honeycomb/health on the cell server
management.endpoints.web.base-path=/honeycomb/actuator
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
management.endpoint.health.group.liveness.include=cellLiveness
management.endpoint.health.group.readiness.include=cellReadiness

# Actuator basic auth credentials (change before production)
actuator.user=admin
actuator.password=changeit

# Service discovery configuration
# Base URL used when only ports are provided. In containers, this should be a
# service DNS name, e.g. http://sample-service
service.discovery.base-url=http://localhost

# Static discovery options (comma-separated)
# cell.addresses.SampleModel=sample-service:8081,other-service:8082
# cell.ports.SampleModel=8081,8082
