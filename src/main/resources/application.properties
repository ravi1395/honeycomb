## Domain-specific port overrides
# Example: to run the SampleModel domain on port 9090, set:
# domain.ports.SampleModel=9090
# You can also uncomment the example below to enable it by default when running locally:
# domain.ports.SampleModel=9090

# If a domain class is annotated with @Domain(port=xxxx) that port will be used
# unless overridden here. Use the domain name (the value of @Domain or the
# domain class simple name) as the property key suffix.

# Health endpoint per domain is available at /honeycomb/health on the domain server
